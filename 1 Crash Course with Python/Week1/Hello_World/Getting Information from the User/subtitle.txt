[MUSIC] On the whole, for a program to be useful it needs to get
at least some information from the user. With this data, the program can take
actions that are relevant to the user, instead of generic actions,
like printing hello world. Data can be provided to a computer
in a bunch of different ways. For example, on a website you might input
data by entering text into text fields or clicking links. If you're using a mobile application,
maybe you'll click on buttons or select preferences from a drop-down menu. In a command line program, you might
provide additional data by passing strings this parameters to the program, or you could have the program ask you for
data interactively. All of these various platforms, programs,
and apps process data differently. Some might take the contents of
a file as data to be processed, others gather data from other sources and
process it in the background. Remember our earlier example, when we
automated the process of identifying and removing duplicate emails? There, the data provided to
the program was the list of emails, which would usually be given in a file
that lists the emails one per line. Whichever way your application gets the
data, it will need to come from somewhere. For our first examples in this course, we'll just have the data as its
own line in our block of code. This is limited, but straightforward. Later in this course,
and in upcoming courses, we'll introduce you to better ways
of feeding data into your code. For now though, let's see this idea
in action in a very simple example. By having the name separate from
the call to the print function, we're making the line of code that
calls the print function generic, while still personalizing the greeting. If we then wanted to say hello to
a different person, we only need to change the name, but the call to the print
function will remain the same. Pretty simple, right? Next up, we'll learn a few other easy things
that you can get Python to do for you.
